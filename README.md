# üóì Event Calendar

Full stack app that renders data from a JSON file in a calendar-alike component.

# Cloning the repo and running it locally

In order to run the project locally, run the following command to install the node modules on both backend and frontend files:

1. /backend

```
npm install
```

2. /frontend

```
npm install
```

# Backend

The backend was built using NodeJS and ExpressJS. 

- listens on port 3000
- sends data from the sportsData.json file

### Running the server

In order to run the server:

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```
cd backend
```

2. Run the following command:

```
node server.js
```

üëè Server.js is now running on port 3000!

# üé® Frontend

The frontend was built using Vue 3, Vuex and vue-router.

### Running the frontend

In order to run the frontend, run the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

### üìê Code Design and Architecture

#### Frontend

##### `CalendarComponent.vue`

This is the component that displays a table of events in a calendar format. 

The table uses the `v-for` directive to loop through an array of `event` objects, and each row has a `@click` event that calls a `function` to show the details of the selected event. The selected event is stored in the component's data and displayed in a separate section using the `v-if` directive. 

The same process applies for a `newEvent`, with a separate section displaying the details of the `newEvent`, but on the same `card` as the `events`.

The code also uses Vuex's `mapState` to map `state` properties to local component properties.

##### `EventForm.vue`

This is the component that renders a form that allows users to add new events to the calendar table in `CalendarComponent.vue`. 

The form uses `v-model` directives to bind the input fields to the `newEvent` object in the component's `data`. The form also has a `submit` event that calls the `onSubmit` method when the form is submitted. 

The `onSubmit` method dispatches a Vuex `action` to add the `newEvent` to the `store` and then clears the `newEvent` object. 

The form also checks if the input fields are not empty, and if the fields are not empty, it dispatches the `addEvent` action, which adds a new event to `newEvent`.

##### `index.js` (store)

The store of the project has the following properties and has been configured using the Vuex library bootstrapped uing the `vue-cli` on the `vue create frontend`:

- `state`: which contains `events`, `newEvent`, and `selectedEvent` properties.
- `getters`: which exposes the `events` and `newEvent` properties from the `state`.
- `mutations`: which are responsible for changing the `state` in a predictable way. The `SET_EVENTS` mutation sets the `events` `state` property, the `ADD_EVENT` mutation pushes the `newEvent` to the `state`, and the `CLEAR_SELECTED_EVENT` mutation sets the `selectedEvent` property to `null`.
- `actions`: which are responsible for handling the logic and `commit` mutations. The `fetchEvents` action makes an `HTTP` request to the server to fetch the `events` and then commits the `SET_EVENTS` mutation. The `addEvent` action commits the `ADD_EVENT` mutation and the `clearSelectedEvent` action commits the `CLEAR_SELECTED_EVENT` mutation.

The store uses the `axios` library to make an `HTTP` request to a `localhost` server running on `port 3000` to fetch events data and it's listening on the `"/events"` endpoint. Then the data is committed to the `state`.

#### üî© Backend

##### `server.js`

This is the Node.js Express server that listens on `port 3000` and uses the `cors` `middleware` to handle `cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)`. 

When the server receives a `GET` request to the `'/events'` endpoint, it reads a JSON file containing event data, and sends the data back to the client in the response. 

The `app.listen()` method starts the server and logs a message to the console when it is ready to receive requests.

The frontend fetches the events data to display it in the table of events in `CalendarComponent.vue`.
